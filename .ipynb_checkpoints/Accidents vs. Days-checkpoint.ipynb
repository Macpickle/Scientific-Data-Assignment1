    "Throughout the week automobiles transport billions across the globe, facilitation the flow of people and goods essential for the modern world. Vehicles connect communities and economies around the world to further evolve the world to higher levels. The impact of automobiles extend beyond just transportation, they impact urban plans and social dynamics as having the independence of a vehicle gives the user to pursue opportunities that they once couldn't. from these daily driving patterns, a crucial question arises: does the time of day, or the day of the week influence the amount of accidents that occur within a given day? Exploring this problem can provide invaluable insight into driving habits we should have to increase safety while driving. It can also influence policymakers to change policies to ensure a much safer driving experience for all drivers. \n",
    "To investigate this issues, I utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle, a website that provides open source data sets that can be analyzed and studied to find trends driving habits. This dataset used to analyze this problem spans the years 2017 to 2020 providing over 12000 incidents and is derived from authentic manual records of road traffic accidents.\n",
    "Viewing this data provides with many questions that I was eager to explore further in order to enhance my understanding of driving habits and safety. As I am a newer driver, analyzing this dataset will provide insight to keep me informed to further protect myself from any dangers on the road. The many complexetities of driving patterns and various factors that affect a safe driving experience is important to me to study and understand to ensure my safety on the road."
